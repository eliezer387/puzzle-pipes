evolution test


## Description

The application has been developed using React and redux, also for the ui components I used styled components
for handling state I used redux like I mentioned before and React context for handling the calls to websocket

I haven't solved any levels üôÅ

some of limitations I have detected in my solution: 
 * lack of optimization for levels 4-5-6, I tried to implement some 
libraries that can handle a huge number of elements but found some problems so I continued using normal divs.
 * hard to visualize first level on big screens without making zoom.

I implemented unit tests for ui components and redux store, testing the context with websocket is more challenging.
